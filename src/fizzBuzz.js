// Create a function called 'fizzBuzz' that takes an integer as an argument and following the rules of FizzBuzz,
// returns "Fizz" if the integer is divisible by 3,
// returns "Buzz" if the integer is divisible by 5,
// and returns "FizzBuzz" if the integer is divisible by both 3 and 5,
// After the function is created make sure to add the line 'export default fizzBuzz'.
